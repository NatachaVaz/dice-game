# dice-game
Welcome to my first coding game project: a simple Dice Game! This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is designed for two players, and the player with the higher dice roll wins.

💻The HTML file sets up the basic structure of the page, including the container for the dice and the heading to display the game result.

🖍The CSS file is used to style the game elements, such as the container, dice images, and text.

🤸🏻‍♀️The JavaScript file contains the logic to generate random dice rolls and determine the game result.
